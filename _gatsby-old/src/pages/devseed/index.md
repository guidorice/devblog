[Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/) and it's partners use Open
Data and Open Source Technology to effect social, democratic, and economic
change. Development Seed is based in Washington DC, with offices in
Portugal and Peru, plus remote employees in USA, Canada and India. I will be
working remotely from New Mexico, USA.

I am looking forward to being part of the DevSeed team, and contributing to a
